<p>I&rsquo;ve found what I think are some new and better ways to query
Google Knowledge Graph data and see how you&rsquo;re doing for SEO on select
terms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m speaking about this method at PubCon 2019 in Las Vegas, October 9th, and will
release a tool at the time as well (for free!).</p>

<p>The technique should work for a while, I&rsquo;m not doing anything &lsquo;bad&rsquo; though I doubt
Google intended this to work&hellip; maybe they&rsquo;ll rate limit these calls or something.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-knowledge-graph">What is the knowledge graph?</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re doing SEO and don&rsquo;t know the answer to this question so far, I&rsquo;m afraid
my content won&rsquo;t be helpful, as it is decidedly advanced.</p>

<p>Google’s goal is to provide accurate information in response to users’ search queries,
within the shortest possible time. It’s part of the Google mission statement.</p>

<p>Every Google algorithm update is built to help Google achieve its mission statement.</p>

<p>So, then, what exactly is the Knowledge Graph? It’s Google’s systematic way of putting
facts, people and places together, to create interconnected search results that are more
accurate and relevant. More specifically, the “knowledge graph” is a database that collects
millions of pieces of data about keywords people frequently search for on the World wide web
and the intent behind those keywords, based on the already available content. With the
knowledge graph, users can get information about people, facts and places that are interconnected
in one way or the other.</p>

<p>So there are various things you can do for your site that also help Google. Most of this is
standard good SEO, but because of the programmatic nature of KG, you can do more via API calls,
which is what my tool does.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post slides after my talk, and release tools in the coming days!</p>
